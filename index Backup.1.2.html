  <h2> About </h2>
  <img src="img/400x400profilePicFixed.jpg" width="310" height="310">
  <p1>
    I am Kati Ren, an illustrator from Germany based in Sweden.
    I mainly work on stories and artworks for children books using watercolours, as well as other tools such as digital art programs, pencils and markers.
    My main goal is to paint stories that are both beautiful and meaningful, helping children to understand the fast changing world we live in today.
    On the side, I enjoy streaming art-tutorials and working together with others on various projects.

    The things I love to paint the most are adorable animals, captivating characters, tiny towns and peaceful panoramas.
    Also, I am experimenting with animation and explore diffrent possibilities to create something new!
    Please take your time to look through my gallery.
